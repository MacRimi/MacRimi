# Hello there! 👋 I'm MacRimi

💻 Passionate about technology, servers, Proxmox VE, computers, home automation, retro games, *The Goonies*, *Star Wars*...  
And back to what really drives me: application development. 🚀

That’s where I truly enjoy myself and where I feel most at home.  
All my projects are born from my own needs, and I’ve always believed that if something is useful to me, it might also be useful to others. That’s why everything I build is crafted with care, attention to detail, and genuine love—because at the end of the day, I build it for myself first.

👶 My journey into programming started in 2009, when I got my first Mac and began exploring development and programming logic.  
My first steps were with FileMaker, writing scripts connected to a database.

In 2014, I built a complete management, invoicing, and maintenance system for the company I work for—and it's still working like a charm to this day!

Although if I go further back, around the year 2000, I created my first website: an online portal with news and tools for my city. Since then, I’ve never stopped learning—React, Next.js, Bash, Python… My curious mind just can’t sit still. 🤓

🎮 I’ve always been more interested in **how a game works** than actually playing it.  
More into **how a computer works** than just using it.  
More into **editing a photo** than simply looking at it.

## 🌟 Projects I’m proud of

### 🖥️ **ProxMenux**
An interactive menu designed to make using, managing, and maintaining Proxmox VE easier for any user, regardless of their experience or technical knowledge.

### 🎥 **HWEncoderX**
A Docker-based app for transcoding video files using GPU acceleration. Super powerful, yet simple and easy to use. Just the way I like it: practical and efficient.

## 🧠 My philosophy

> "What we do in life echoes in eternity."  
> — Maximus Decimus Meridius

I always try to help others in any way I can—enjoying the journey along the way. And that’s how it will always be.
